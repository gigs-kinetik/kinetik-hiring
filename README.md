# Project Management System with AI Agent Support

Welcome to the **Project Management System** repository. This project streamlines collaborative software development by integrating an AI agent that oversees task division, scheduling, developer assignment, and iterative code evaluation. The agent also ensures adherence to project specifications and optimizes for performance and scalability.

## Features

1. **Project Proposal and Initialization**
    - Companies can submit detailed project proposals.
    - The system evaluates available resources and initiates developer hiring if none are currently assigned.

2. **Agent Functionality**
    - **Task Management:** Divides the main task into granular, manageable subtasks.
    - **Scheduling:** Generates a timeline with clear deadlines for each task.
    - **Developer Assignment:** Matches developers to tasks based on skill sets, interests, and provides starter code for implementation.
    - **Support During Development:** Developers can query the agent for guidance on implementation and debugging.

3. **Development Workflow**
    - Developers implement solutions and submit code for evaluation.
    - Developers collaborate with the agent and teammates through well-defined interaction protocols.

4. **Code Evaluation and Feedback**
    - The agent writes and runs comprehensive test suites for submitted code.
    - Evaluates code correctness, efficiency, and alignment with project specifications.
    - Provides actionable feedback on system design and optimization.

5. **Code Integration**
    - The agent merges individual developer contributions into a cohesive production-ready codebase.
